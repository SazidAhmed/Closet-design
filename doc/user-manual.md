# Closet Designer — User Manual

Welcome to the Closet Designer! This application allows you to design your perfect storage solution from floor plan to 3D visualization.

## 1. Phase 1: Floor Plan Designer

The first step is defining the room where your closet will live.

- **Wall Configuration**: Click and drag wall corners or handles to resize the room.
- **Room Height**: Use the "Room Height" button (top left) to set the ceiling height.
- **Architecture Items**: Drag doors, windows, and columns from the left sidebar onto any wall.
- **Repositioning**: Click and drag placed items along a wall to move them, or use the "✕" button to delete them.

## 2. Phase 2: Design Closet

Once your room is set, move to the Design step to build the closet itself.

- **Drag & Reorder**: You can drag towers left or right to change their order in the layout.
- **Shelf & Rod Logic**: Use the configuration panel to add/remove shelves, rods, and drawers.
